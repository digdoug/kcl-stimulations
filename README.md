# kcl-stimulations

I wrote this code in the summer of 2012 while at Harvard Medical School.

I determined how KCl-mediated stimulations rewires neural circuits. Specifically I looked at ~100 genes induced in the brain during neural activity.
For these genes I determined classification categories using differential equation models which explian gene induction.

The data I used is proprietary and isn't included in this repo.
